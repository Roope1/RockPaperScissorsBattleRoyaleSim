50 random walkers whom have been assinged a role of rock, paper or scissors randomly. When the walkers collide they "play" a match of rock-paper-scissors, and the loser of the matchup gets converted to the winners role. So when rock and paper collide, rock becomes paper, and so on. Game continues until all the contestants are the same type.
